# ProxyLogger
 ProxyLogger is a lightweight Swift-based system proxy daemon that intercepts browser traffic using macOS proxy settings and mitmdump. It logs URLs with timestamps to /tmp/proxy_log.txt and prints them to the terminal.  ProxyLogger runs as a background service via com.proxylogger.daemon.plist, making it suitable for traffic inspection and logging.
